## Before publishing

If you have selected the `release` feature, please check the following points:

1. Make sure you add your [NPM_TOKEN](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow) as a secret in your [repo configuration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
2. Edit the `.gitignore` file and comment/uncomment the lines required for publication.

   ```bash
   # remove or comment the following line when you want to publish
   .github/workflows/test-release.yaml

   # uncomment the following line when you want to publish
   # .github/workflows/test.yaml
   ```

3. Edit the `package.json` and make it public.

   ```json
   {
     "private": false,
     "publishConfig": {
       "access": "public"
     }
   }
   ```

It's all good ðŸš€ the next time you push on the main branch your package will be automatically published on NPM.
